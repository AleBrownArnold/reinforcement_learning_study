# Reinforcement Learning Study

This project is a collection of things I'm using to learn Reinforcement Learning.


# Trainable Agents
There are a number of different agents to train with different RL techniques.

### Q-Learning
Check the [available agents](https://github.com/fiquinho/reinforcement_learning_study/tree/master/agents/q_learning)
trained to complete different task using Q-Learning.
