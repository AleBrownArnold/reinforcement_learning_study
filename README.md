# Reinforcement Learning Study

This project is a collection of things I'm using to learn Reinforcement Learning.


# Trainable Agents
There are a number of different agents to train with different RL techniques.

## Q-Learning
 - #### Move to Goal
    Check the [available agents](https://github.com/fiquinho/reinforcement_learning_study/tree/master/agents/q_learning/move_to_goal)
that can be trained to play different versions of this environment using Q-Learning.

## Deep-Q-Learning
 - ####  Mountain Car
    Train an agent that plays the [MountainCar](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/) environment 
using Deep Q Learning for action-value function approximation.
